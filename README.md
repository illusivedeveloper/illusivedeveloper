# Hello, there!

Welcome to my small corner on GitHub. I code sometimes on fun projects and ideas which I come across. I also contribute to opensource projects which I find interesting occasionally. This is my casual account on GitHub so you won't find much activity here.

You can reach out to me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devnitish) or follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/__nitis__).

Adios!
